# Operators & Loops Module

This folder contains basic C++ programs demonstrating operators, loops, and conditionals. Below is a summary and explanation of each file.

---

## 1. `1stloop.cpp`
**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates the use of a simple loop in C++.

**How it works:**  
Typically, this file contains a `for` or `while` loop that prints numbers or repeats an action multiple times.  
*Example:* Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.

---

## 2. `conditionals.cpp`
**Purpose:**  
Shows how conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`) work in C++.

**How it works:**  
The code takes input (like a number or character) and uses conditionals to decide what to print or do.  
*Example:* Checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

---

## 3. `loops.cpp`
**Purpose:**  
Explains different types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

**How it works:**  
The file demonstrates each loop type, often by printing a sequence or performing a calculation repeatedly.  
*Example:* Printing even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop, and odd numbers using a `while` loop.

## 4. `namastey.cpp`
**Purpose:**  
A simple introductory program, usually printing "Namastey Duniya" or similar greeting.

**How it works:**  
Contains a basic `main()` function with a `cout` statement to print a message.  
*Example Output:*  
```
Namastey Duniya
```

## How to Run

1. Open any `.cpp` file in this folder.
2. Compile using:  
   ```
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename.exe
   ```
3. Run using:  
   ```
   filename.exe
   ```

## Summary

- **Loops** help repeat actions.
- **Conditionals** help make decisions.
- **Operators** (used inside loops and conditionals) perform calculations and comparisons.
